# **About Me**

Welcome welcome!  My name is Yan :wave:.


I was born in China and moved to Luxembourg when I was 5 years old. I currently live in Queensland, Australia. I am on the verge of completing my  Ph.D. degree in computer vision. My thesis has been submitted, and while I wait for feedback, I created this website to document my research. 

You can find my CV [here](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFvCL8Mye8/Yj2aVuDQMgc0hRrpQqFOXQ/view?utm_content=DAFvCL8Mye8&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=publishsharelink). Below is a brief timeline of my studies and work experiences.
